Abeja Cabernet Sauvignon 2006,"Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,91,"Gorgeous, refined and supple, this is our flagship wine from a vintage defined by elegance and grace ? picture a dancer. The 2006 growing season started with a mild spring but finished with an usually dry, hot summer. This led to earlier-than-usual flavor maturity, and while we had hoped for the corresponding lower-than-normal sugar levels as well, the result was actually the development of bright higher tone characters and a beautiful clear fruit profile. A good splash of Merlot adds roundness and silkiness, and the bright fruit lends itself to a smooth, polished mid-palate. These elements make for a pretty, lush wine that is approachable and delicious upon release. The age of the vines, seventy-five percent of which are twenty years or older, contributes to its aging potential. "

Abreu Vineyards Cappella 2010,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,98,"Cappella is one of the oldest vineyard sites in St. Helena. Six acres that sit alongside a Catholic cemetery on the west side of town, it was first planted in 1869. In the 1980s the church asked David to tear out the old vines, then he watched as the land lay fallow for close to two decades. When he finally got the chance to replant, he jumped. He'd tasted fruit from Cappella in the 70s. He knew what kind of wine it could make. But that first replant was ill-fated thanks to diseased rootstock, and once again he was ripping out vines. ¡°It took us six years before we had a crop. We could have ignored it, pulled the vines out one by one as they collapsed. But then we'd have all these different ripening patterns, which would impact consistency. It was an easy decision.¡±"
